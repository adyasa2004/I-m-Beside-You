## **About the Project**
Mom Agent is a persona-driven AI assistant designed to help students like me **study efficiently** while also making sure we **take care of our basic well-being**, just like a caring mom would.  

It combines **learning assistance** and **wellness reminders** in one interactive AI agent, so you can focus on your studies without forgetting to eat, drink water, or take small breaks.

## **Core Features**
1. **Study Assistance**  
   - Generates **concise lecture notes** (5 bullet points) from pasted text or PDFs.  
   - Generates **5 short quiz questions** with answers to test your understanding.  
   - Planner + Executor multi-agent architecture ensures stepwise reasoning and execution.  

2. **Wellness Reminders**  
   - Scheduled reminders for meals and drinking water.  
   - Desktop notifications mimic a caring mom checking in on you.  

3. **Interactive UI**  
   - Built using **Streamlit** for an easy-to-use web interface.  
   - Sections for study, care reminders, logs, and GitHub submission.  

4. **Interaction Logs**  
   - All AI prompts and outputs are logged in **`logs.txt`** for reproducibility and evaluation.
